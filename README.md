# Friend Finder - Node and Express Application

## Description
The objective of this project was to build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application.  The app is based on a survey consisting of 10 statements.  The user will decide how strongly they agree with the statements by ranking each statement between 1 and 5.  5 being strongly agree, 1 being not so much.  Once the user submits the survey, the user will be presented with a potential match of a new friend.

## Design
The application was developed using Node.JS and Express.JS for the backend components.  Bootstrap and jQuery were used to design the survey and front end user experience.

## Demo
